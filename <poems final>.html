    <h2>Poems</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the heart of Mirrorland, where Arabella's adventures are woven into poetic verses. Each poem captures a moment, a feeling, a piece of her journey.</p>
    <h3>Delusions</h3>
<!-- --> I create delusions to escape reality
I daydream on what is imaginary 
I talk to a mirror on the wall
Wondering when I would be called
But it declines

I'm just trying to keep my head in line
It runs away to the small world It made for me
Where I always be
Dreaming of something I’ll never see

Wondering If this was a reality

That is where I long to be
In a world that only I can see
I wake up in a world that isn't made for me
Thinking why it was made for me
In the end, I created a world in my head
Where I liked to be instead.
    <h3>Mr. Rabbit</h3>
    <!--   --> Mr rabbit tall and fair
Why are you always there?
Because of that I look at you and stare
Your eyes are like the galaxy 
When I look at you I feel like I'm out of reality
You clear the darkest skies in my 
I sit there and cry but you pulled me out instead
His laugh stirred my head
I fell down the rabbit hole
Giving you my heart and soul 
Your warm embrace 
Never makes me feel hate
Even though I know I hate this state 
Oh I love it and hate it at the same time
Just trying to keep my head in line
But it runs back to you where it likes to be instead
Just calling you a friend
    <h3>Midori</h3>
    <!-- -->  I can spot you in the miss of the crowds
With a heart that is proud
A tall man with skin white and fairI look at him standing there
And he looked at me like there was something in me worth looking at
I wanted to feel nothing whenever I see him but you looked at me in the eyes and I felt everything all at oneWith eyes looking like the sun
And when I’m with him it’s really fun
This is the end for meMy eyes can no longer see
How your just a friend to me
    <h3>Sky Full of Stars</h3>
    <!-- -->  I always believe that when someone dies they become a dazzling star
Because of that I will always watch the night sky from afar 
They leave there love as light That will shine upon us in the deepest darkest nights
My love’s light
Is a very radiant sightThat always takes away my fright
They left us there love as a light 
As they cross the rainbow bridge 
They will always have courageNo pain no suffering
I’m sorry that the world couldn’t keep you safe
But right now you have already found a soft and peaceful place
As you leave your love of lightThat light will guide me in my path of life
    <h3>My Ride Or Die</h3>
    <!-- --> It doesn’t matter how long people kew each other what matters is who walked with you in the darkness of the night and the light of the day 
I cherish my friend to the point I couldn’t stay away
They are one of the foundation of my life without them I would crumble
I need them to be stable 
They are the only one’s who understand me and can bare my personality 
They are the people who pulls me back to reality
As I cry in the darkness of the night they are the light that came to save me
As they know Im not ok they will never let me be
They always give me a shoulder to lean on 
I have a strong bond with me friends 
And I will cherished them to the end
    <h3>Best</h3>
<!---->  I miss you the most when I’m full of stories with no one to tell
When you pass by I feel like hell
You were always my partner in crime 
What happened to all those times
I see our pictures on my phone
And ask myself why did you left me alone
To my best friend 
I thought our friendship would never end
You were my ride or dieI always thought that was right
I cry myself to sleep
Thinking of all our memorize
You introduced me to my happiness right nowI was always loyal to you because that was my vow
Even though it' was lonely and there was no place to lean on
Even though it was painful, and there was no place to stop
The earth it seemed like a deserted island to me
But at that time you were next to me
I believed you and I would flyand run for our lives
As we would sore high in the dark sky
But I guess that will never happen 
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
You are and will always be my best friend
And in my heart our friendship and memories
Will never end 
    <h3> Paraluman</h3>
<!-- --> Siya ay tanglaw
Kailangan araw-araw
Paraluman ko
    <h3>Losing Battle</h3>
<!-- --> I fell deep down the rabbit whole
 In a dark place with nowhere to go
Nothing but dark clouds and snow
Until I saw a glow
I walk towards the glow and see what it has to show
It was a tall man who’s skin was white and fair 

He said he would take me anywhere 
But spending time with him gave me pain to bare
Not knowing when I’ll get there
Until my last breath I laid there and just stared
Thinking of the day we will meet again
So what will I do then?
    
    <h3>My Mother </h3>
<!-- --> She is strong and brave
She can suppress thousands of waves
She is kind and smart
She also has a loving heart
She is my hero
A light that shines so bright
In the darkness of the night
Her courage is her crown
and she wore it like a queen 
She is beautiful inside and out
And that is never a doubt 
She is my mother
And she is like no other
    <h3>Moving On</h3>
    <!--  --> And suddenly all the songs were about you
Because of that I didnt know what to do
Your voice is my favorite sound
It’s like saving when from chains I was bound
Where the light came in and I was found
You were the definition of in the world of boys his a gentlemen
Where my heart could have been
But we were in the wrong place and time
Because we didn’t have the courge to not be diclined
I hate that I’m still hoping
To the point I can’t stop coping
You were my comfort place
And that the felling I dont want to erase
But I need to let go
So I could grow
